Welcome to the AdventureWorks Business Intelligence and Data Visualization Project. This project showcases my expertise in data analytics, data modeling, and data visualization using Power BI.

## Project Overview


In this project, I have demonstrated my ability to work with complex datasets and create a powerful data model that provides valuable insights into AdventureWorks's business operations. The project encompasses the following key components:

- **Data Preparation and Transformation:** I started by sourcing data from various CSV files related to AdventureWorks's customers, products, stores, regions, calendar, returns, and transactions. Data preparation included data type verification, column renaming, merging columns, creating calculated columns, and handling conditional data transformations.

- **Data Modeling:** Once the data was ready, I established a robust data model in Power BI. I set up relationships between tables, ensured proper cardinality, and utilized lookup tables effectively to establish connections between data tables. 

- **Data Visualization:** In the report view, I designed an interactive and informative dashboard. I organized the tables in the model view, arranged relationships to ensure data integrity, and applied formatting to enhance the user experience.

- **Calculated Columns and Measures:** In the data view, I created various calculated columns and measures to provide deeper insights into the data. These included calculations for customer age, priority, price tier, years since remodel, and more. Additionally, I developed measures for total transactions, total profit, return rate, revenue, cost, and profit margin.

- **Visualization Development:** The report included a variety of visuals, such as matrix tables, KPI cards, maps, treemaps, column charts, and gauge charts. I implemented advanced features like conditional formatting, data bars, color scales, and visual level filters to make the information more interactive and accessible.

- **Bookmarks and Insights:** To enhance user interactivity, I incorporated bookmarks to allow users to navigate the report effortlessly and added notes to provide context and insights on specific data points or trends.

- **Creative Exploration:** Beyond the core project requirements, I continued to explore the data creatively, uncovering additional insights and creating new visuals and pages to showcase the potential of the data.
